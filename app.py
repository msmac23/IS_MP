# Learning style context
context = (
    "The four types of learning styles: Visual, Auditory, Reading/writing and Kinesthetic. "
    "Describe visual learners - Visual learners prefer visual representations of information, such as diagrams, charts, graphs, and maps. "
    "However, they don't necessarily respond well to photos or videos, rather needing their information using different visual aids such as patterns and shapes. "
    "Describe auditory learners - Auditory learners are individuals who learn through listening. They are prone to sorting their ideas after speaking rather than thinking ideas through before. "
    "Describe Kinesthetic learners - Kinesthetic learners are individuals who prefer to learn by doing and hands-on experience. "
    "Describe reading/writing learners - Reading/writing learners prefer to engage with text-based information. These individuals usually perform very well on written assignments. "
    "To find out your learning style: take the VARK questionnaire linked above, observation of study habits, self-assessment of information retention preferences, experimentation with different study techniques. "
    "Does age affect learning styles: Children often benefit from kinesthetic methods, teenagers from social-learning approaches, adults from reading/writing strategies for professional development."
